#### Book

You must have heard of “For you, a thousand times over.” from a book called The Kite Runner.

Guilt, love, betrayal, tears. The Kite runner has it all. 

The Kite Runner <b>is among the most touching</b> books<b> I have come across</b>.

The author <b>knows how to keep his readers engaged through vivid description of  the imagery and by bringing the characters to life in a stunning way.</b>

I had read this book for several times, but every time I read, I burst into teats. The Kite Runner <b>is the only book I have read so far which had me in tears</b>.

From the bond between a father and a son, to the bond between close friends, The Kite Runner <b>captures relationships and emotions so beautifully that the reader will be left shocked while reading the book.</b>

<b>The Kite Runner is one of the very few books that will leave an impact on the reader for a very long time.</b>
