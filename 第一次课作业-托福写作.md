> 2. Getting advice from friends of an older age would be more valuable than from friends your own age
>
> As modern technology flourished in personal entertainment with myriad chances hindering the way of self-development, children all-over the world are being challenged with specific situation or sophisticated problems, thus hours and hours were wasted causing numerous problems in their physical and mental health, and led to poor performance academically and later professionally, which make them to get advice from others with more experience. Personally speaking, it’s my belief that the advice from older one are greater utility. 
>
> To begin with, with more experience, the older are in the position to give us efficient methods which can prevent us from inappropriate behaviors or wasting time. What we are experiencing is similar to theirs in the past in general which illustrates that advice from them would increase resilience to difficulty and mitigate disruption from hidden danger. A compelling example is that quite of people are looking forward to going abroad for further study especially in China. Therefore, it’s inevitable that we head for suggestions from the senior who will give you a right direction based on his own experience. Although it seems to be a nice choice to navigate your direction independently boosting  your specific skills for the future, in that case, numerous time will be wasted on the unnecessary items such as searching information online, contemplating what you need to prepare and so on which will  wear your patience or make you stuck in a stagnant pace. On the contrary, with the senior’ advice, there will be less obstructs constraining your way and what you’re proposed to do is just keep pacing in the steadfast direction.

> In addition, the older, who often have higher education background, combined with broader horizon, could provide us more professional suggestions. On the contrary, our peers are less likely to have such in-depth analysis. For example, it’s crucial that we have a long-term vision in career plan including me. When I asked the professors in my major about career plan, a plan were devised under their comprehensive analysis which composed the past and future facts. It’s their advice that helped me go straight down my load without wrong turnings. Not only dose it benefit us, but it also effects country. Take case of Japan, the reason why Japan became so prosperous even reached the height of the second biggest country during the 1990s is that Japan learned from US. To extent, the older’ advice would be great help in your life especially your turning point.

> Admittedly, advice from our peers, could be more up-to-date sometimes. Peers grew up in the same environment, which put them in the best position to offer advice. For instance, it’s common that the older would be conservative in some situation, they hold the disinclination to risk. In our daily life, we always heard from our older that it’s better for us to find a stable job and live a stable life. Nevertheless, our peers would advice you to try something new with more potential benefits instead of living the stable status although we must take a risk. Obviously, challenging instead of living stably is more valuable in current society.

> In a nutshell, I maintain that we should listening advice from the older more would be more valuable, and maybe some people may oppose me. However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.
