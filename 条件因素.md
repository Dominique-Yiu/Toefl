段落规划：

第一段：背景可以讲当今社会压力非常大，人人都想着找到一条快速成功的道路，有相当一部分人往往想通过将自己的强项展示出来，以此达到快速晋升的目的。有些人这默默苦干，提升自己，觉得这样不仅有利于自己也有利于团队

第二段：让步段，可以说将自己的强项展示出来，能够更好的体现自己的价值，一方面能够大大提升自己的自信力，对自己的自我认识有相当大的好处。更好的情况是，能够很快的得到提升的机会比如担任团队核心的机会，晋升的机会等

第三段：反转段，讲这样的坏处，比如常常吹捧自己，可能让领导厌烦，会适得其反，甚至在说的和自己做的不匹配的情况下，给他们留下一个非常不好的影响，会认为是一个轻浮不务实的一个人；另外，这种行为会引起和同事之间的矛盾，对工作环境有不好的影响。就这个点举一个范例，比如网络环境下的一些“人上人”秀优越感的形为。

第四段：中心段，人外有人，谦卑不仅能够和同时又个很好的关系，同时能够从不同的人学到他人的长处，即使自己很优秀，但术业有专攻，总有技不如人的地方。对比一下两种情况下“机会”的区别，一种是被动的，一种是主动的创造机会。例子周星驰/史泰龙

第五段：总结

With the dramatic increase of social burden upon the young and the trend in a stratified society driven by inequitable status, the image of the young struggling for success illustrated that in order to succeed, they are finding a shortcut based on showing their strengths. Contrary to established beliefs that exposing their strengths can promote themselves quickly and steadily, I still believe it is more conducive for themselves, their teams and even the entire company without exposing strengths.

Admittedly, there do exist benefits when they advertise for themselves in some circumstances. Advertising for themselves by showing strengths, a congruent method to leave an indelible impression on others, makes their values be discovered to the maximum extent, thereby the obscure future will be clearer and more tangible. Furthermore, under more caring and supervision from influential people, their confidence will be constructed at a high level, which is of paramount importance to their self-perception. Even better, they can attain some unexpected opportunities to elevate themselves, such as playing the key role in teamwork, promoting the position and so on.

Nevertheless, with others assimilating the idea that they are perfect, they need to confront some unnecessary situations. Showing themselves too much will make our boss get sensitive, which contradicts the previous goal. This kind of excessive behavior will leave their boss a bad impression that they are non-pragmatic, impeding the way to progress in the future. In addition, their working environment will deteriorate during the process, because this behavior could confuse their colleagues and magnify the conflict. For example, especially on the Internet, there is always that kind of people to show how much they know or how they are better than others, which destructs the Internet ethos.

Generally speaking, being humble instead of exposing strengths too much is a valuable treasure that we need to cherish with the expense of the whole life. Regarding life as a climbing adventure, no matter where they stand, there is still someone that they need to look up to. Being humble, they can learn a lot from multifarious kinds of people, at the same time, the relationship will develop in a harmonious way. In fact, they are provided chances when they let others know their strengths, instead, they are creating opportunities by themselves as they try to be humble, implying that the discrepancy offers the latter one more potential energy. Take Stephen Chow as an example, who played an inconsequential role in the movies at the previous age and became the most illustrious movie star over the world later. During his experience, he never complained about his background and pretended as a proficient actor to boast his talents, on the contrary, all things he had done were to equip himself with more abilities, thus he succeeded. 

In a nutshell, I maintain that people should not make others know about their strengths and accomplishments in order to have a successful life, and maybe some people may oppose me. However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

第一段：当今，人们总想着能够出生在一个富裕的家庭中，常常将自己的而不成功归咎于自己没有他人幸运，输在了起点。

第二段：让步段，幸运能够让你赢在起点，比如足够幸运出生优越，受到的教育，交到的朋友，生活的条件和环境等都很不一样；幸运能够让你得到意想不到的结果，比如做科学实验，实验的成功往往和自身的运气有关，运气好可能能够完成几年才能完成的事情。

第三段：反转段，幸运能够让你赢在起点，但未必能保证一直领先，成功的因素很多，更重要的是善于利用自己的幸运；过度依赖运气，会使自己堕落，（穷人和有条件的人对比

第四段：中心主体段，幸运并不是一种与生俱来的，更重要的于人，例子牛顿；幸运并不只是一个被动的过程，我们可以创造幸运，提升自己，让自己更强大，自然更幸运，例子马云；

第五段：总结

> > Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
> >
> > improving schools is the most important factor for the successful development of a country.

主体：

school$\rightarrow$primary school, high school, university

important factor$\rightarrow$stable, peace, technology, economy, infrastructure 

country: poor, developing, developed status

第一段：人们普遍认为，人才是一个国家发展的必要条件，那么教育就是对于国家成功发展的最重要的因素。但国家成功发展，需要依照国情指定不同的方针。

第二段：让步段，增加对大学的投资，能够让大学有更好的设备，实验条件等，也可以引入更好的师资，对于学生的培养非常有益；能够吸引世界各地优秀的学生；这些学生未来能够给国家发展带来巨大的潜力。

第三段：过于注重教育，而不是其他，比如基础设施的建设，那么大部分民众的生活会变得极其不方便，接着可能会导致，大量人才的流失

第四段：提升哪一方面的发展是取决于一个国家的基本国情的。在一个治安混乱，国家不稳定的国家，稳定和和平是他们当前最重要的目标；在一个欠发达地区，如何让人吃饱穿暖是最重要的目标；在一个发展中地区，怎么进一步提升人民生活质量是最重要的目标；在发达地区由于所有的先决条件都具备，因此发展教育成为了最重要的一环。举例：美国/中国
