>  Sally in the letter suggests the university should pave running trails near campus with cement (5s) because it would increase students’ safety（5s）and the better look of the trails would encourage more students to use them(5s). （共15s） 
>
> But the man thinks it’s a terrible idea (5s). He thinks the girl is not  thinking about the long-term consequence of running on hard surface.  If students repeatedly run on hard surface, it can lead to injuries on  bones and joints. But if they run on the soft surface, the damage will be  less.（20s）. Besides, he doesn’t think students will like the new look  because now it’s like they’re taking a break out in the nature. But if the  road is paved with cement, it’s like they are running on a regular street or sidewalk, which is not relaxing at all (20s). (共45s)

> TPO2：（学校新闻）
>
> The university has decided to stop its free bus service for students because few students ride the buses and the expensive operation fees can be saved to expand overcrowded student parking lots. But the man disagrees with this plan. He thinks the reason why few students take the buses is that the route is out of date.It only goes through the neighborhoods that are too expensive for students to live in. So if the route is changed, more students will ride the buses.
>
> Besides, eliminating free bus service and adding more parking lots only encourage more students to drive on campus, which will create more noise, traffic jams, and the  requirement for more parking lots.
