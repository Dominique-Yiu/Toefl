年轻有大把的活力

年轻的时候是最需要见世面的时候

With the social development accelerating and the working atmosphere among the young becoming more intensive, which gets the young to involve in an endless involution war, much more extra time that should be spent in flourishing your personal life would be wasted, and finding the easy happiness surrounding every corner of your life seems to be the most arduous thing. It’s inevitable that people advise you to be unremitting in making money instead of instant gratification such as traveling or doing whatever you like which means all the entertaining things need to be put off at an old age. At that time, all of your enthusiasm will be faded, so traveling at a young age couldn’t be a better choice.
There do exist benefits when you are older to travel abroad to visit different countries. After a long term of striving for a better life, tremendous pressure has been accumulated. Therefore, it’s a pivotal time for them to get out of the stress, and a crucial piece of obtaining happiness for them involves traveling. For example, during the process of travel, without the pressure from any aspect of their life, they will be satisfied with the pure happiness which is conducive to their mental health and even lengthens their lifetime. On the other hand, at that stage, thanks to the early accumulation, they have enough money to try more things which make the travel replete with more pleasant. To the extent, there are many benefits of it.
Nevertheless, the young age is the most energetic status, filled with enough curiosity, and we need to expose our strong wish to explore the mysterious world such as traveling to different countries. If we miss that moment, our energy and enthusiasm will be faded and it will leave some regrets. In addition, it’s a great chance for us to broaden our horizons, experiencing different cultures which will bring our life more possibilities. Having a comprehensive view of the world at an early age would promote the likelihood of a huge success which means you could have a more promising life in the future. In other words, it’ll be an illusion if you choose to travel older.
Generally speaking, having a compelling journey at a young age is the most correct choice. We are always sensitive about unknown things and we absorb knowledge easily, at the same time, our outlook on life and value are established at a young age. Apparently, the height of your life depends on the depth of your view over the world, so your view is the prerequisite of your success. Traveling different countries, bringing you numerous perspectives to see the world, seems to be a necessary thing to go through at a young age. Take Jack Ma, one of the most successful businessmen and former CEO and founder of Alibaba, who traveled to Australia in his early 20s for example, he devoted himself to the online industry when returned to China. If he had never been overseas at this young age, he would not have found his focus for the future. 
It is certainly inadvisable that we do not travel abroad until someday when we are older. Instead, we should seize the youth and do it now.
